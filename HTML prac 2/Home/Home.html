          <h2>what will this site do?</h2>
          <p>
            This site will have 3 themed dummy websites to showcase a range of
            what I have learned so far. Whilst the focus is on the code itself
            which you cannot see here, the designs I have chosen will showcase
            my skills with CSS and general typography.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that this site is compatible with both mobile and
            desktop, so feel free to switch between based on your preference.
