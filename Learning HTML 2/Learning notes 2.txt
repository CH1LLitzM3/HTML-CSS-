
Typography:

-3 types of fonts
Serif - the font with the little lines at the edge of the letters (posh font)
sans-serif - similar to serif but without the extra little lines (more chill)
monospace - each letter takes the same amount of space (coding font)

font-family: roboto, helvetica, sans-serif;

- this sets the font, if it cannot apply the first one, it will try the 
next and so on. this makes your font choice more likely to work with different browsers/devices and still
keep the intended vibe

font-weight: 700; 
- this sets the thickness of your font, higher numbers are thicker and vice versa

- it is worth noting that it is best practice to avoid using black as your font color, change it to any shade 
lighter of your choice as it is easier on the eyes

font-style: italic;
- this will simply change the style of your font

font-size: 1rem;
- this sets the size of your font

- its best practice to set an overall font style onto your body or more general elements, and then
making use of inheritance to change specifics such as a header

uploading custom web fonts:

3 options for sites:
fontsquirrel.com
myfonts.com
fonts.com

- Fonts need to be in the correct format for websites, the best will be .woff or .woff2
- not all browsers support woff2 so its good practice to upload both woff and woff2 variants to your site

how to:
1. choose font and download
2. use generator feature on fontsquirrel.com(as an example) and upload both the regular and bold versions
3. uncompress file and copy both the woff,woff2 versions of the regular and bold font into a fonts folder on your file
4. you will also be given a stylesheet.css file to copy into this folder, you will need to include the path for each font
for example styles/fonts/customfont-blah-blah.woff2 
5. for regular, dont change font weight and style
6. for bold, ensure font weight and style is changed to bold
7. copy paste these 2 chunks into your style.css and ensure it is at the top of your file as it needs to be loaded first
8. optional, but you can rename the font-family to whatver you like for ease of use
9. then use the same way as any other font

FOUT:

- this is when the user experiences a delay in downloading a custom font, typically as a result of a slow network
- hard to avoid entirely but there are ways to make it less jarring
within your @font-face:

display: auto/swap - this will replace the fallback font with the custom one when downloaded, can be jarring as it can
shift elements around and is just annoying for a user with slow connection

display: block - does not show text until font is downloaded, bad practice to use and can often break sites for a 
user with slow connection

display: fallback - will use the fallback and if the custom font takes too long to download, it just sticks with
the fallback

display: optional - same as fallback, but will cache the font for the next time user loads the page, a bit weird to
use as site will look different compared to the first use, try to avoid

Google web fonts:
- amazing and popular fonts, for my use case just use these its quicker, easier, more reliable and google has done
most of the work for me

fonts.google.com

1. choose font, select the weights and amount of fonts you need
2. top right to view selection when im done, or to tweak whats in my "basket"7
3. will give me a <link>, copy and paste it above any other links on my html
4. you can modify the url itself to add/remove fonts and weights, aswell as the display(swap,optional etc)

-**this site will also state the liscencing for the fonts, ALWAYS CHECK THEY ARE FREE TO USE**
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

system fonts:
- pure performance and more familiar to the user as its what their OS uses, it also avoid FOUTs

to use:
font-family: -apple-system (and just tab it in) - this will select all current OS fonts for each platform
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

veritcal spacing:
- its good practice to use spacing to make sure our different pieces of content dont look connected, so we use spacing
so that a user will naturally perceive them as 2 different things

on your text element (so a h1 or body etc etc):

margin: (above)rem 0 (below)rem - use a larger margin above, and a smaller margin below

line-height: 1.5rem - changes the space between each line, it is good practice to apply this to the body
and to use 1.5rem, but for specific design it can be any number

- for the sake of future proofing, just use 1.5 as it will be your base font size x1.5, if you were to change your 
font size otherwise you will also have to change line height.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

horizontal spacing:
- this is used for when different fonts dont look right on your site

letter-spacing: px; - this can be posotive, negative or 0 based on preference

word-spacing: px; - same again

width: 50ch; - this will state the amount of characters per line, its best practice to land somewhere between
50-70 characters for a user. 50ch is 50 zeros of space and is best practice to use, but tweak it slightly for the 
sake of design preference
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Text formatting:
- super useful for correctly structuring your text in the need of your design

examples:
text-align: ; - states where text goes along the line, so left, right, or centred
text-indent: ; - will add an indent to the first line of content
p + p text-indent: ; - an example of indenting the first line after following paragraphs, you might not want an indent after a heading
text-decoration: ; - to set underline or line-through
text-tranform: ; - use for lowercase, uppercase, capitalise

(with a set width for lines)
white-space: nowrap; - will force all text onto 1 line
- this will likely cause overflow and look bad so to fix:
overflow: hidden;
- but now its unclear why the text suddenly gets cut of so:
tex-overflow: ellipsis; 
- this will now cut off the text, preventing overflow AND display a ... to the end of the text

column-count: ; - this will split text into multiple columns
column-gap: ; - this will state the gap between each column
column-rule: px solid black; - this will set a border between each column

direction: ; - will set the reading direction, good for languages but likely not useful to me
