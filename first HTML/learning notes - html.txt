<h1><h1>    is largest and most important heading, should only ever have 1
then use h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 - they get smaller as you go through 1-6
doesnt affect your code, but important for structure and organising your site

html entities make it so you can type special characters without it being misread as code
simply search up html entities to grab whatever symbol you need

when using hyperlinks <a href="location and name of site">text that will be hyperlinked</a> , if they are in the same folder
simply use "sitename.html", if it is in another folder state the folder too so "dummyfolder/sitename.html"
- images can also be hyperlinked simply replace what would have been the text with your image syntax instead

For getting free photos, and videos with audio, use unsplashed.com and sketch.com respectively or pexels.com for both

some browsers may not be compatible with video elements, use caniuse.com to check what browsers(and their version) are compatible

divs/containers are a great way to organise chunks of elements of your website to kepp things structured, easy
to read and generally clean for a user

<span> is useless on its own, but works great when you need to apply a change to something thats in the middle of other
things. for example highlighting specific words in a paragraph of text.
- you would use span in combination with a class or other global elements to make it serve a function

semantic elements: 
- a more organised way to contain certain things, these are better identified by a search engine and make your code
easier to return to as it is more descriptive

<article> - used to contain a piece of written text like an article, this can contain anything such as a header, paragraph
, images etc. it is simply better practice to use over <div>

<figure> - same as article, but for images. this also allows you to add a <figcaption> either above or below your chosen
image/video. 

<time> - same as the above, but for time. for more accuracy you can add a datetime="" which is machine readable
and once again better understood by a search engine.

structure:

<header> - used for <nav> navigation bars typically or other immediately useful code

<main> - used to contain the main chunk of the content within your website, although you should only use 1 of 
these, there's no reason not to have multiple <section> containing multiple <article> etc etc

<section> - usually used to group relevant content together

<footer> - same use as a header, however at the bottom of the page

<aside> - used to contain bits of unrelevant content or miscellaneous items
